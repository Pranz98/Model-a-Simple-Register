Project Description:

In this project, I designed and verified an 8-bit register using SystemVerilog. The project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in hardware description and verification using SystemVerilog, a hardware description and verification language commonly used in the semiconductor and electronics industries.

Design Specifications:

Data and Output:

Both data and out are 8-bit logic vectors.

Reset Signal:

rst_ is an asynchronous and active low reset signal.

Clocking:

The register is clocked on the rising edge of the clk.

Enable Signal:

If enable is high, the input data is passed to the output out.
If enable is low, the current value of out is retained in the register.

HDL Used : System Verilog
Tools Used : Cadence XCELIUM
